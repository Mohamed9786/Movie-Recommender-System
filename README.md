# Movie-Recommender-System

### This project implements a movie recommendation system using Collaborative Filtering with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). It uses the Surprise library for building the recommendation model, and pandas for data manipulation.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to recommend movies to users based on their previous ratings. The system utilizes a dataset containing user ratings for various movies and applies collaborative filtering techniques to make predictions about movies that a user may like.

The model is built using SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), a popular matrix factorization technique used for recommender systems.
